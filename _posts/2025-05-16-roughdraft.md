# Introduction + Why I Chose this Topic

Picture this: you have a Calculus test tomorrow which you have not studied for. You get home, sit down at your desk, and start solving some problems. After what feels like 5 hours have passed, you take a break by using social media on your phone. Why do you do this? Would you feel more or less motivated to study after your break? 

Like many students, I have experienced the preceding scenario. Social media has become one of the biggest threats to our generation in terms of attention span, ability to concentrate, mental health, and much more. A study found that 67% of teenagers use 3+ hours of social media per day, and coupling these facts with my experiences, I decided that for my final project, I would seek to determine the relationship between hours of social media usage and subsequent motivation to study. Also, I decided to pick this topic because I did independent, scientific research outside of school in junior year regarding mental health and music. Wanting to continue pursuing mental health in a different aspect that I have done before, and after reading lots of scientific papers for inspiration, I settled on my topic. 

# Data

Still deciding which graphs I want to present, and making more histograms for F and M Graphs 1 and 2

I will also be making a simulation for an intervention for this motivation issue
