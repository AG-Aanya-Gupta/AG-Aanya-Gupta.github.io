# Introduction + Why I Chose this Topic


# Data

## Females:

From the histogram, it was found that 5-10 mins and 10-30 mins were the most selected answers (each 7 times) for how much social media was used during female students' study breaks. The minimum social media usage was 5-10 minutes and the maximum was 1 hour+. Since no responses listed 1-5 minutes despite it being an option, it was omitted from the graph. As shown by the distribution, this isn’t a normal distribution; it's skewed way right! From the graph, it can be concluded that the students were not distributed equally across the social media usage gathered.

From the histogram, it was found that 3 was the most selected answer (8 times) for how motivated female students felt after study breaks involving social media. The minimum motivation was 1 and the maximum was 4. Since no responses listed 5 despite it being an option, it was omitted from the graph. As shown by the distribution, this isn’t a normal distribution either; it's skewed left! From the graph, it can be concluded that the students were not distributed equally across the motivation levels gathered.

From the scatter plot–as shown by the generally downward trend in the points and the negative slope of the linear regression line–as hours of social media usage during sudy breaks increased, motivation to study decreased. Coupled with the determined correlation coefficient of -0.75, it could be determined that a significant, inverse, and negative relationship exists between social media usage and motivation. This makes sense not only because other studies have validated this relationship, but also because social media is extremely addictive; when you watch social media, you brain produces short, bursts of dopamine. Hence, the more you watch, the harder it will be to stop watching, leading to decreased motivation when you force yourself to stop using social media and focus on something that (probably) doesn't induce as much dopamine production in your brain: studying. 

## Males:

From the histogram, it was found that 5-10 mins was the most selected answers (6 times) for how much social media was used during male students' study breaks. The minimum social media usage was 5-10 minutes and the maximum was 1 hour+. Here, 1-5 minutes was omitted from the graph as well. This distribution was skewed right.

From the histogram, it was found that 2 and 3 were the most selected answers (each 5 times) for how motivated male students felt after study breaks involving social media. The minimum motivation was 1 and the maximum was 4. 5 was omitted from the graph as well. This distribution is not a normal one, but it is also not skewed either left or right, as seen in graph. 

![mgraph3](/assets/mgraph3.jpg)

As seen in the scatter plot for females, from this scatter plot–as seen through the generally downward trend in the points and the negative slope of the linear regression line–as hours of social media usage during study breaks increased, motivation to study decreased. Coupled with the determined correlation coefficient of -0.78, it could be determined that a significant, inverse, and negative relationship exists between social media usage and motivation. This makes sense for the same reason as for females.
