# Introduction + Why I Chose this Topic

Picture this: you have a Calculus test tomorrow which you have not studied for. You get home, sit down at your desk, and start solving some problems. After what feels like 5 hours have passed, you take a break by using social media on your phone. Why would you do this? Would you feel more or less motivatve to study after your break? What impact would this have on your academic performance?  

I have experienced the preceding scenario quite frequently. Social media has become one of the biggest threats to our generation in terms of attention span, ability to concentrate, mental health, and much more. A study found that 67% of teenagers use 3+ hours of social media per day, and coupling these facts with my experiences, I decided that for my final project, I would seek to determine the relationship between hours of social media usage and subsequent motivation to study.
