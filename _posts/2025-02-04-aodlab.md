First, I read the assignment description and realized that I needed to find 2 data visualizations. 

Naturally, the first thing I searched up was “Articles with Data Visualizations.” Luckily, the NYT had a great article with 75 links to various graphs, and they were specifically designed for student analysis. After searching for a bit, I found two different graphs which seemed interesting, and that I thought I could recreate. 

## Data Visualization 1

[Link to the actual graph](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/learning/whats-going-on-in-this-graph-feb-9-2022.html)

This was my methodology (there’s a reason it’s numbered!)

1. I estimated the coordinates of each point on the original graph, and went on Google Sheets to write them into a csv file. 
1. I created my scatter plot with `alt.Chart` and `.mark_circle()`
1. The graph was pretty small, so I changed the size using `.properties()`
1. I created the y=x black line apparent on the real graph using `mark_line`. However, I had to look up how to represent y=x (the source is listed in my code)
1. I realized that some of the data points didn’t seem to be in the right place, so I edited the csv file I created. 
1. I noticed that the x and y-axis domain and spacing was different from the original graph. I asked Ms. Feng how to change it and I learned I could use `alt.Axis` and `alt.Scale`
1. I had no idea how to put text *onto* a graph and position it, so I looked it up (source listed in code) and found that I could use`pd.DataFrame` and `mark_text`
1. After some repositioning of various little things, I finalized the graph!
