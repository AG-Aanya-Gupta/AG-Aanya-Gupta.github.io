WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT DUE TILL LATER

It was Thanksgiving, so I first had some turkey, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and apple pie. Then, I began working on Part 2 of this lab! 

I ran the code to make sure my new CSV file looked okay, but I realised that only one row had data for all of the indicators (India, 2000). Yikes! I went back to my old code and added more countries for which data would be obtained.
